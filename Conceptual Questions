1. Classification Basics
a. Explain the difference between classification and regression.
b. Give two examples each of:
• Binary classification
• Multiclass classification
c. Define the following evaluation metrics:
• Accuracy
• Precision
• Recall
• F1 Score
• Confusion Matrix
2. Logistic Regression
a. Why is logistic regression considered a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm?
b. What is the role of the sigmoid function in logistic regression?
c. List two advantages and two disadvantages of logistic regression.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
a. What does it mean that KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm?
b. Describe the steps of how KNN classifies a new data point.
c. Explain how choosing a small K vs. a large K affects the model.
d. Why is feature scaling (normalization/standardization) important for KNN?
